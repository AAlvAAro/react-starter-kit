## 🔮 Enabling SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

> *"You have to let it all go, Neo. Fear, doubt, and disbelief. Free your mind."*

### Step 1: Uncomment the hydration code

Open `app/frontend/entrypoints/inertia.ts`:

```ts
// Uncomment the following to enable SSR hydration:
if (el.hasChildNodes()) {
  hydrateRoot(el, createElement(App, props))
  return
}
```

### Step 2: Configure deployment

Open `config/deploy.yml` and uncomment:

```yml
servers:
  vite_ssr:
    hosts:
      - 192.168.0.1
    cmd: bundle exec vite ssr
    options:
      network-alias: vite_ssr

env:
  clear:
    INERTIA_SSR_ENABLED: true
    INERTIA_SSR_URL: "http://vite_ssr:13714"

builder:
  dockerfile: Dockerfile-ssr
```

**You are The One.** Deploy with SSR support.
